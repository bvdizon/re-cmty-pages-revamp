                <p>True to its name, Scenic Acres is a picturesque residential neighbourhood nestled in the northwest quadrant of Calgary, Alberta. Located on the fringes of the Bow River Valley, residents can enjoy stunning view of the Canadian Rocky Mountains while still staying connected to a comfortable and modern lifestyle.</p>
                <p>The urban development is well connected to the surrounding areas by road. Crowchild Trail runs through the north, Nose Hill Drive to the south and east, and Stoney Trail to the west of Scenic Acres.</p>
                <p>The streets of the Scenic Acres neighbourhood are lined with a mix of old and new homes. Most of the homes are single-family dwellings and represent about ninety percent of the total housing available. However, there are several multi-unit projects under construction. A notable development is the retirement residence by Revera which offers a welcoming and safe living space for the elderly. Other developments include a few multi-family projects like the well-planned 183-unit, an eight-story project designed by the IBI Group.</p>
                <p>The river access and the breathtaking views from the ravine overlooking the river offer attractive natural surroundings. Additionally, the mountains to the west and Paskapoo Slopes to the south give the location a high visual impact. Scenic Acres boasts a stunning environment and natural beauty at its doorstep.</p>
                <p>The real estate benefits of Scenic Acres do not end with tranquil surroundings and panoramic natural beauty. Residents of this quiet community enjoy access to several parks, walking paths, and green spaces. Families living in the neighbourhood can enjoy some fun activities like skating, ice hockey, and broomball at the Crowchild Twin Arena, a highly sought-after public skating arena.</p>
                <p>Residents do not have to worry when it comes to their grocery shopping as they have easy access to the Crowfoot Shopping Center, which includes an abundance of shops. You will find popular supermarkets and food chains like Home Depot, Tim Horton's, Safeway, and Co-op. It also houses many restaurants, Cineplex Odeon Theatres, and Chapter's book store. Scenic Acres is right next to well-established neighbourhoods like <a href="/tuscany.php">Tuscany</a>, <a href="/arbour-lake.php">Arbour Lake</a>, and <a href="/silver-springs.php">Silver Springs</a>.</p>
