                    <h3 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Shopping &mdash;</h3>
                    <p>The community has some great options for shopping and dining. Every Saturday, the Calgary Farmers' Market has pop-up events at which you can buy products made, grown or baked in Alberta.</p>
                    <p>The Mexican restaurant Salt & Pepper is popular among locals for its delicious food and stellar service. The neighbourhood nail salon and spa is the place for unwinding and pampering.</p>
                </div>
                <div style="margin-top: 50px;">
                    <h3 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Parks &mdash;</h3>
                    <p>Parks within a community or situated a short distance away provide residents with an inexpensive way to enjoy the outdoors, socialize and play. Greenwood-Greenbriar residents have a choice of two excellent parks located nearby - Bowmont Park and Bowness Park.</p>
                    <h4>Bowmont Park </h4>
                    <p>This is a 192 hectares park on the northern bank of the Bow River, connecting Bowness and Montgomery. 'Bowmont' is a portmanteau of these communities' names.</p>
                    <p>The urban park has a lovely and functional design, comprising grasslands, valleys, gullies, off-leash dog-walking areas, a waterfall with a lookout, and hiking, walking and cycling trails. The pathways along clifftops and the river below provide views of the city from various vantage points.</p>
                    <p>To the north of the train tracks, you can use the pathways to get to the Fournier Area. It has ponds and marshy areas where you can spot local wildlife. Parking south of the train tracks gives you easy access to a fenced off-leash area for your pooches. This area of the park offers many access points to the river, including off-leash access for pets that enjoy splashing about in the water.</p>
                    <h4>Bowness Park</h4>
                    <p>The 3- hectare park is located along the Bow River, between Stoney Trail and 85 Street NW. It is home to a lagoon that runs along the park’s southern side and is covered by ice from December to March. It is a popular spot for ice skating, open from morning to night, subject to weather conditions.</p>
                    <p>Bowness Park is popular all year, so you may want to visit on a weekday to skip the crowd or in the evenings when the rink is decorated with LED lights. There are plenty of benches at the lagoon and the seating area has rubber mats so you can safely walk to the lagoon in your skates. If you want to take a breather, you can warm up by the fire pit. The skating rink at the park offers a range of activities and services, from ice-biking and cross-country skiing to dining.</p>
                    <p>The east side of the park has a playground. A ridable miniature railway operates seasonally. The park is used to launch boats on the Bow River.</p>
