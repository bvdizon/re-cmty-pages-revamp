                <p>Collingwood's hills, open areas, and beautiful family homes make it a favourite choice for property buyers in Calgary.</p>
                <p>It is a residential community in Calgary, Alberta's northwest quadrant. It lies west of 14th Street W and directly south of Nose Hill Park as well as John Laurie Boulevard. Confederation Park, Canmore Park, and the Confederation Park golf course are all to the south.</p>
                <p>The local retail facilities, as well as those further afield, are easily accessible. The LRT is minutes away in <a href="/brentwood.php">Brentwood</a>, and 14 St. NW crosses through Collingwood making it easy to travel the city. If you require services outside of the neighbourhood, you may easily obtain them by driving or via public transportation.</p>
                <p>When you buy a home in Collingwood, you have access to paved bikeways, wilderness trails, cross-country skiing, golf, and ice skating, to name some of the activities you can indulge in after a hectic day of work.</p>
                <p>Single-family houses dominate the real estate market in this mature neighbourhood. Due to its proximity to downtown, Nose Hill Park, and the prestigious Calgary Winter Club, a private recreation club providing tennis, curling, squash, state-of-the-art fitness facilities, and much more, real estate in this area is in high demand.</p>
