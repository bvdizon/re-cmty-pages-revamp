                <p>Kincora is a mesmerizing residential neighbourhood situated in the northwest area of Calgary, Alberta, Canada. The name and design of the community draw inspiration from the story of an Irish legendary high king, Brian Boru, the king who once ruled the entire country of Celtic Ireland. Kincora is the name of a fort that he rebuilt in the 11th century. Therefore, the community's name and architecture are influenced by the Celtic theme, which boasts of a stone entry wall, lantern street lights, and many other features.</p>
                <p>Kincora is one of the five communities located in the Symons Valley area. It neighbours the <a href="/sherwood.php">Sherwood</a> community across the Shaganappi Trail to the west. On the north, it neighbours the <a href="/sage-hill.php">Sage Hill</a> community, the <a href="/evanston.php">Evanston</a> community to the east, and the <a href="/hidden-valley.php">Hidden Valley</a> community to the south.</p>
                <p>The residential neighbourhood is maintained by the Kincora Community Association. It is an organization that was created by the residents of the community in 2008. The association is made up of volunteers who look after the development and maintenance of the residential area. The volunteers are not only involved in the maintenance of the community but also organize social and recreational activities in the neighbourhood.</p>
