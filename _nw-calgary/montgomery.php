                <p>Montgomery is a residential community located in North West Calgary, bordered on the East by Shaganappi Trail and on the North by 32nd Avenue and Market Mall. The family-friendly, inner-city neighbourhood is located just minutes away from downtown Calgary on the banks of the tranquil Bow River. The community of <a href="https://www.real-estate.ca/bowness.php">Bowness</a> lies just across the river to the West of Montgomery. The neighbourhood is distinguished by expansive outdoor spaces, cycling paths, kidsâ€™ playgrounds and picnic areas.</p>
                <p>Shouldice Park, a notable landmark in Montgomery, is a whopping 28 hectares of outdoor space that includes picnic grounds, soccer fields, and batting cages-all located within easy access to Bow River. Another beautiful outdoor space in Montgomery is the Jumpstart Inclusive Playground, a 15000 square feet of play space designed so that children of all abilities can play together in harmony. This hidden gem is yet another aspect that makes Montgomery the warm and family-friendly community that it is.</p>
                <p>Montgomery is also an excellent neighbourhood for canine lovers with numerous veterinary services, dog parks, spas and daycare facilities. Montgomery is well connected with excellent neighbours: Market Mall on the North West, the new Alberta Children's Hospital on the East and the soon-to-be-developed University of Calgary's West Campus.</p>
                <p>The community is well served with schools for all grades, including Terrace Road Elementary School (Public) and the "Foundations for the Future" charter academy, which serves grades 9-12. The active community association of Montgomery regularly holds events, including annual events that provide fun and entertainment for kids and adults alike.

Other programs and events held by the community association include a self-guided historical walking tour and the annual 'Humpty's Awards.'</p>
                <p>Eating out in Montgomery is characterized by diverse offerings with Aksa Wiener Schnitzel Haus, Five Spice Kitchen, Papa Nikolas Pizza and Abbey's Creations, some of the must-visit restaurants in the neighbourhood. If you are looking for a fancier meal in the suburbs with downtown energy, the award-winning open kitchen restaurant NOtable is a great option with an excellent vegetarian and vegan-friendly menu.</p>
