                <p>Dalhousie is a neighbourhood in Calgary's northwest district. John Laurie Boulevard runs through it on the north, Shaganappi Trail on the east, Crowchild Trail on the south, and Sarcee Trail on the west.</p>
                <p>Dalhousie residents enjoy living in a well established neighbourhood close to top-rated schools, shopping centers, recreation amenities and the University.</p>
                <p>The remarkable quantity of mature trees that decorate the streets is something you'll notice the second you reach the neighbourhood. Dalhousie is predominantly a retirement neighbourhood, with many of the homes built in the 1960s and 1970s.</p>
                <p>Some of the houses in this community have been tastefully updated before being listed, while others allow you to choose which upgrades you would prefer. If you're looking for the perfect single-family house, Dalhousie is the place to go. The streets' intricate layout keeps unwanted cars to a minimum, and there is plenty of street parking for visitors.</p>
