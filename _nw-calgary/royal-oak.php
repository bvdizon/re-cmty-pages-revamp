                <p>Royal Oak is a community in Calgary, northwest quadrant. Country Hills Boulevard runs through it on the north, Stoney Trail on the east, Crowchild Trail on the south, and Rocky Ridge Road on the west. Royal Oak is a community near Calgary's <a href="/rocky-ridge.php">Rocky Ridge</a>.</p>
                <p>This stunning neighbourhood, which was founded in 1998, is endowed with a gently undulating topography that affords many of the houses excellent mountain vistas.</p>
                <p>Royal Oak is a great place for young families that enjoy being outside. Throughout the neighbourhood, there are numerous little stormwater ponds. A journey to Canmore or Banff is merely minutes away due to its location on the city's western outskirts. Everything a busy family needs is close at hand, including major retail and commercial services.</p>
                <p>The Royal Oak Shopping Centre, as well as other facilities, are easily accessible to residents. LRT services are also available in the area, with a "Park-n-Ride" facility set to open soon.</p>
                <p>Royal Oak's elegant, expensive residences and condominiums are typical of newer Calgary communities developed during the oil industry boom. Young professionals with expendable income like the convenience of being able to shop at neighbouring Starbucks and high-end apparel businesses. Some big-box businesses are also growing in the neighbourhood, giving customers even more alternatives.</p>
