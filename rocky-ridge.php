                    <h3 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Parks &mdash;</h3>
                    <p>Parks are, beyond a doubt, the heart and soul of any neighbourhood. Having parks nearby has several advantages. First, they ensure that you breathe clean air as the green trees work hard at purifying the air quality. Second, it gives you an ideal environment to perform exercises or yoga and plays an important role in keeping you fit. Third, they provide an excellent opportunity for your children to meet new people, make friends, and practice communication and socialization skills. Fourth, when you are confused about where to host a family outing, parks are always a good choice as they have something for everyone.</p>
                    <p>Hence, whether you want to go on a family picnic, help your kids mingle, or go on a stroll, Rocky Ridge has an adequate number of parks for you to enjoy. There are four parks in the area, each with playgrounds and walking trails. For baseball fans, one of these parks, Rocky Ridge Boulevard NW Park, includes two sports fields and three ball diamonds. Furthermore, this park has access to a wading pool and tennis courts and is regarded as one of the best spots for children.</p>
                    <p>Another popular park is Rocky Ridge Landing Park. The beautiful trees set along a pond make it perhaps the most picturesque park in the whole of Calgary. This park is only an 8-minute walk away from the centre of the community. So, you can enjoy nature at its best as and when you like. While you may always enjoy recreational and peaceful activities in these parks during the summer, you can also visit them during the cold winter months. During winters, you get to experience the beauty of nature as the entire park, including its trees and flowers, is blanketed in snow.</p>
                    <p>Some other parks that are located nearby are Rocky Ridge Close NW Playground and Rocky Ridge Dr NW Park. If you love to play golf, you can take your buddies on an 8-minute drive to a private golf club named Lynx Ridge Golf Club and have a great day.</p>
