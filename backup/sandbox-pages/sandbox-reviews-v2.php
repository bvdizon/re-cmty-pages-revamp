            <p style="position: relative; z-index: 5;">I cannot stress enough how incredibly organized, helpful,
                professional, and attentive May Davidson is - as a first time homebuyer, I was incredibly thankful to
                have been connected with her on this. Her approach to educating their clients and providing honest
                feedback is greatly appreciated and made the homebuying process much more fun and a lot less stressful.
                She's been a fantastic resource and highly recommend her to any others who are new to the market.</p>

            <p style="position: relative; z-index: 5;">Sarah Walczak was amazing throughout the sale of my Father's
                home. She ensured we were aware of every step in the process and was honest in regards to what we could
                expect regarding wait times and costs. She made the whole process more relaxed and understandable. We
                will be asking her to guide us through our next home sale as well.</p>
