        <div class="grid_12">
            <div class="x6">
                <p>Since its establishment in 1982, the area has developed steadily, attracting families and
                    professional couples alike.</p>
                <p>Applewood Park is bound to the north by the Canadian National Railway, south by 17 Avenue, east by
                    the East Freeway and west by 68 Street. The neighbourhood is located in proximity to International
                    Avenue and the Market at Quarry Park. Trips to the local cleaner, gym or park can easily be
                    accomplished on foot.</p>
                <p>There are a number of parks and green spaces in and around the community. A championship golf course
                    and Calgary&rsquo;s famous bird sanctuary are a short distance away.</p>
                <p>Residents have quick access to essential services and public transit. The public bus system is
                    efficient and operates on all days of the week.</p>
                <p>Applewood Park has a strong sense of community. The Applewood Park Community Association organises a
                    variety of events that promote a sense of belonging, safety and enjoyment. The neighbourhood also
                    enjoys a low crime rate.</p>
