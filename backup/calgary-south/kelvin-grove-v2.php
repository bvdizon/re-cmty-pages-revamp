            <h2>FAQs about Kelvin Grove Real Estate and Neighborhood</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h3>How do I get about within the community?</h3>
                    <p>The neighbourhood of Kelvin Grove is the 96th most walkable neighbourhood in Calgary. The area
                        has excellent bike infrastructure, which makes this a very bikeable area as well. However, this
                        is a car-dependant neighbourhood, and you will need a car to run most of your errands.</p>
                    <p>Downtown Calgary is a quick ride on public transport &ndash; an excellent public transport system
                        connects the neighbourhood. Or, if you prefer, you can drive to the city center, which is not
                        very far away.</p>
                    <p>There is at least one bus route passing through the community.</p>
                    <p>The nearest LRT is Heritage CTrain Station which is about 2 kilometers south of Chinook Centre.
                        Other nearby LRT stations include Chinook CTrain Station and Southland CTrain Station. Anderson
                        CTrain Station and 39 Avenue CTrain Station are less than three kilometers away.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Are there any cultural amenities nearby?</h3>
                    <p>History buffs will be glad to know the Military Museums 3.5 kilometers northwest of the
                        community.</p>
                    <p>Heritage Park Historical Village &ndash; Canada&rsquo;s largest living museum is a seven-minute
                        (approximate) drive away and spans over 127 acres. As well as being one of the city&rsquo;s most
                        visited tourist attractions, it is a fantastic place to hang out with the family. The park has
                        various museums and daily activities. There is a seasonal living history village depicting life
                        from the 1860s to the 1930s&mdash;other attractions include sailing on a paddlewheel boat and
                        train rides in an antique steam train.</p>
