                    <p>A suburban community in southwest Calgary, Millrise was established in 1982, though it was
                        annexed by the city in 1961 as part of the Area Structure Plan, aka Midnapore Phase II. Millrise
                        is a simple, quiet community with fresh air and rich green vegetation. With many to do around
                        and easy access to public transport, Millrise is an ideal place for those who love a quiet place
                        in the suburbs.</p>
