<h2>The Lake Bonavista Real Estate Market</h2>
<p>Construction on Lake Bonavista began in 1967 by Keith Construction Company. The close proximity to Fish Creek Park
    makes Lake Bonavista homes an ideal spot for outdoor people. Lake Bonavista real estate consists of several lowrise
    condo buildings in the northwest portion of the community, overlooking Anderson Road and McLeod Trail. In the rest
    of the community are bungalow style housing and two storey housing, dating back to the time the community was built.
    The more luxury homes are situated around the lakes, with many of them enjoying private docks.</p>
