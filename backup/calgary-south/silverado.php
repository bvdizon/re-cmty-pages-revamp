<h2>Silverado Real Estate Listings Community #165</h2>
<p>This area of new homes in Calgary's deep South is a suburban community with an urban feel. Many of the new homes here
    have been designed in a very modern architecture style. Spruce Meadows owns the real estate bordering the West side
    and runs equestrian events throughout the summer. The 22X provides a quick escape to the Foothills of the Rocky
    Mountains and scenic Bragg Creek.</p>
