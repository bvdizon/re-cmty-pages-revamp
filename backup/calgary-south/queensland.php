<h2>Queensland Real Estate Listings Community #250</h2>
<p>The real estate community of Queensland is an affordable district of bungalows and single detached homes. Properties
    here are older and established family homes. Recreational opportunities are afforded via nearby Fish Creek
    Provincial Park and the web of the Calgary bike paths. The Bow River also flows nearby and offers some picturesque
    walks within close proximity. Major roadways include the Bow Bottom Trail to Deerfoot Trail and Canyon Meadows
    Drive.</p>
<h2>Queensland Real Estate Market</h2>
<p>As of 2006, Queensland&rsquo;s real estate market is mostly made up of detached and attached single-family homes,
    making up 77.2%, with the remaining 22.8% being apartments and row houses. 17.2% of homes are being used for rental
    purposes.</p>
