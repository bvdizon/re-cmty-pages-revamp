    1959<br /><br />In terms of Calgary real estate, Chinook Park is hard to beat as far as style of home, proximity to
    Water and Parkland, easy access to the city core and valued pricing. The community is well linked to Calgary's major
    roadways, including Glenmore Trail, Elbow Drive and 14th Street. The Heritage Station of the C-Train line is quite
    nearby and Glenmore Reservoir offers exceptional recreation opportunities, including boating, walking and bike
    paths, the Weaselhead Flats hiking, and the Park. Families enjoy Heritage Park throughout the summer and a ferry
    tour is always a good call. <br /><br /><strong>Chinook Park Schools</strong><br />Chinook Park Bilingual Elementary
