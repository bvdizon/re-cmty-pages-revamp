<h2>Cliff Bungalow Homes</h2>
<p>Developed as land for the Canadian Pacific Railway in the 1870&rsquo;s, Cliff Bungalow was annexed by the City of Calgary in 1906 and development began in 1907. In 1935, rezoning began to allow for denser residential buildings following Calgary&rsquo;s population growth. Cliff Bungalow is now a popular residence for people working downtown and around the downtown core, but still has a family friendly atmosphere good enough for children.</p>
