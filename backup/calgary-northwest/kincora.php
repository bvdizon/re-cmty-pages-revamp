<h2>Kincora Real Estate Listings Community #524</h2>
<p>Community Established 2002 <br />Similiar neighbouring communities of <a href="/beddington.php">Beddington</a>, <a href="/sandstone-valley.php">Sandstone</a>, and <a href="/macewan.php">MacEwan</a>.<br /><br />Located in the Northwest area of Calgary. The name and design of the development derive from the story of Brian Boru, Ireland's legendary High King. Therefore, Kincora has a Celtic theme including the Kincora tower, stone entry wall, lantern street lights, and many more features. <br /><br />Kincora is a beautiful community with 120 acres of park and Environmental Reserve, and an extensively landscaped Storm Water pond with play equipment and gazebo. You will be able to enjoy this peaceful environment with the help of walkways that run along the bottom of the ER and throughout the whole community.</p>
