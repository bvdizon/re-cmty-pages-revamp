        target="_self">Strathcona Park</a>.<br />Community Established 1986 <br /><br />Signal Hill is a relatively
    large community situated on the western edge of the built-up area of Calgary. Although the area was annexed to the
    city in 1956, it did not start to develop until 1986. The primary form of development in the area is low density
    residential. Signal Hill is part of an elevated plateau which stretches west for a distance of approximately 7
    kilometres. As a result, there are some excellent views of the mountains and the Elbow River Valley. The Canadian
    Armed Forces used part of the Signal Hill area for training purposes in the First World War. The regiments who
    trained in this area had their identification numbers set, using large characters and stone as the material, into
    the hill side.</p>
<p>The Calgary real estate district of Richmond Hill is split into 2 distinct halves. The East side is a prominent
    retail district with many big brand shops. The residential real estate district of Richmond Hill is comprised
    primarily of low-density single-family homes. The far southwest corner also includes new condo complexes. This
    community lies in the valley below Signal Hill, and backs onto the hillside where the Canadian Armed Forces
    regiments set their identification numbers.</p>
