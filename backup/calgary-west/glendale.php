    Established 1955 <br /><br />Entrance into Glendale is distinguished by the change from the uniform block and grid
    streets in Glenbrook, Killarney, and Rosscarrock into long curvy roads. The street pattern weaving through the real
    estate district of Glendale is a familiar trait of suburban neighbourhoods developed in the late 1950s. Many
    Glendale homes offer mountain views of the Rockies. Outdoor enthusiasts enjoy recreational activities at Glendale
    Meadows, Glendale Athletic Park, Optimist Park, and the Calgary bikes paths.<br /><br /><strong>Glendale
