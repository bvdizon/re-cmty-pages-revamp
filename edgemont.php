                <p>Edgemont is a residential community in north-western Calgary, Alberta, Canada, north of the neighbourhood of <a href="/dalhousie.php">Dalhousie</a>. It is also bordered on the south by John Laurie Boulevard, on the west by Sarcee Trail, on the north by Country Hills Boulevard, and on the east by Shaganappi Trail.</p>
                <p>As seen by the sheer ravines at the community's south-eastern edge, most of Edgemont is a north-western expansion of Nose Hill. Edgemont's hilltop location (1245m at its highest point) offers city views on the south and views of the Rockies on the west.</p>
                <p>Edgemont condominiums and townhouses are available in a variety of price ranges. Large luxury homes worth millions of dollars, as well as modestly priced single-family dwellings, can be found in this neighbourhood. The homeownership rate is approximately 90%, which contributes to the community's well-being.</p>
                <p>Consider this distinctive hilltop community in north-western Calgary if you want to live around a large number of greenspaces. Edgemont Ravine, a network of ravines in northwest Calgary, is surrounded by Edgemont, which provides jogging and cycling paths. It also provides quick access to Nose Hill Park, one of Canada's largest urban parks, with panoramic city views.</p>
