            <p>Spanning nearly 65 hectares, Ambleton is a new community by Qualico Communities in
                northwest Calgary. The established community of Evanston (also by Qualico) is only
                five minutes from Ambleton, taking care of early residents' shopping and
                recreational needs.</p>
            <p>The fully developed community will have lots of green spaces, 7.3 km of regional and
                multi-use trails, schools, parks and recreational centres. A storm pond in the
                northeast corner of the community will serve as an aesthetic feature, retain
                nutrients and remove pollutants.</p>
            <p>A site has been set aside for a Catholic high school. Also in the works, is a
                commercial area and a spacious plaza with gazebos, fire pits and an outdoor ice
                rink.</p>
            <p>The strength of a community is increased through recreational activities. The
                valuable green spaces in Ambleton will beckon residents of all ages and abilities.
                They include five parks and an ecological reserve. The natural setting and scenic
                mountain views are also expected to be a huge draw.</p>
            <p>A major attraction is easy access to commuter routes such as Stoney Trail, 14th St NW
                and 144th Avenue NW, and Highway 1 and 2. Interconnected pathways will ease moving
                about to the neighbouring communities of Evanston, Creekside and Symons Valley.
                Public transit options are a few blocks from the community's entrance.</p>
            <p>The community will be completed over eight phases - 130 homes in Phase 1 and over
                1200 in total. A variety of housing styles from well-known builders make Ambleton
                worthy of consideration by young couples, families and downsizers alike.</p>
            <p>Neighbourhood associations foster care and concern among members and activate
                cooperative action that serves everyone's interests. The Ambleton Owners Association
                (AOA) will protect amenities, keep up a high standard of maintenance in the
                community, and enhance the sense of belonging among residents. The AOA will be
                instrumental in ensuring that the community sustains its desirability and value.

        <h2>Amenities in Ambleton &mdash; Live, Work, &amp; Play</h2>
        <p>Studies show that people who live in proximity to amenities like community parks,
            libraries and theatres are more content with their neighbourhood and less lonely,
            regardless of whether they live in large or small cities, towns or the suburbs. As an
            Ambleton resident, you can enjoy many of the amenities that make community living
            rewarding.</p>
        <div>
            <div style="margin-top: 40px;">
                <h3>Shopping &mdash;</h3>
                <p>Life is easier and more comfortable when everything you want is close to where
                    you are. Ambleton does not disappoint on this account.</p>
                <p>A future commercial area will make shopping and running errands as easy as
                    possible for residents. Plans for retail establishments and neighbourhood
                    grocery stores should turn to reality shortly and make Ambleton a truly
                    desirable place to live.</p>
                <p>Early settlers to the community have no reason to feel inconvenienced either.
                    They can meet their shopping needs at Evanston Towne Centre. The community
                    shopping centre is anchored by Sobeys and Shoppers Drug Mart. It is home to
                    quick-service restaurants, pre-school, fitness and professional services.</p>
                <p>There are many options for dining in the Creek Side Shopping Center including
                    restaurants like the Bro'Kin Yolk, Tuk Tuk Thai, Taiyo Japanese Restaurant and
                    Boston Pizza. Evanston also has a JPs Indian Bistro serving authentic Indian
                    cuisine. More restaurants, shops and services can be expected as the area
                    continues to grow.</p>
                <p>Evanston is located close to CrossIron Mills, which is anchored by the Bass Pro
                    Shop, and features most major brands under one roof, a food court, kid-friendly
                    areas and different art zones. </p>
            </div>
            <div style="margin-top: 40px;">
                <h3>Parks &mdash;</h3>
                <p>Parks are essential to maintaining the quality of life in a community. They
                    function as an environmental purifier and aid the preservation of plant life and
                    wildlife.</p>
                <p>When complete, Ambleton will have five parks and a variety of outdoor
                    recreational facilities. Evanston, which is a stone's throw away, has seven
                    playgrounds and sixteen green spaces interconnected by trails and pathways.
                    Local pathway networks are also planned in Ambleton, which should shorten walks
                    to parks and outdoor leisure centres.</p>
                <p>Ambleton residents have access to the recreational spaces in nearby
                    neighbourhoods as well. Among them is the famous Nose Hill Park, the
                    fourth-largest urban park in Canada and among the largest in North America.</p>
                <p>Nose Hill Park is a beautiful spot that comes alive during spring when the
                    wildflowers are in full bloom. It has a hilly terrain, and paths and trails for
                    bikers, hikers and runners. </p>
                <p>The park has an off-leash area for well-behaved dogs to walk and socialise. You
                    can enjoy a relaxing walk, and catch scenic views of the city and mountains atop
                    Nose Hill. The kids will love watching the deer, porcupines and coyotes. The
                    south side of the park is the perfect place to catch a glimpse of the deer just
                    before sunset. </p>
