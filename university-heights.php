            <h2>University Height Real Estate News</h2>
            <p>University Heights is situated just south of the main campus of the University of Calgary and was previously Prime Minister Stephen Harper's residence while he pursued his degree. It's an ideal area to live if you're also a student at the University, as most of your classes are only a short walk away.</p>
            <p>Being close to school provides advantages even if you are not a student. It gets you, for example, closer to Calgary's Olympic Oval, which was utilized for speed skating competitions during the 1988 Winter Olympics. The Oval is frequently accessible to the general public.</p>
