        <h2>Cliff Bungalow Homes</h2>
        <p>Developed as land for the Canadian Pacific Railway in the 1870’s, Cliff Bungalow was annexed by the City of Calgary in 1906 and development began in 1907. In 1935, rezoning began to allow for denser residential buildings following Calgary’s population growth. Cliff Bungalow is now a popular residence for people working downtown and around the downtown core, but still has a family friendly atmosphere good enough for children.</p>
