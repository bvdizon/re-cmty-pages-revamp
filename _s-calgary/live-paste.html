            <p>Originally encompassed within the community of <a href="/palliser.php">Palliser</a>,
                Pump Hill became an
                independent neighborhood of the South west Calgary only in 1991. The
                community is bounded by the 19 Street W on the west, the Southland Drive on
                the south, the 14 Street W on the east, and the Glenmore Reservoir and the

                Renowned for its luxury single family units and estate homes, the Pump Hill
                real Estate was named after the windmill that once provided water to the
                early settlers’ farms in the area. </p>
            <p>Homes for Sale in Pump Hill are typically
                listed at a starting price of around the late 600s, with a few units being

                natural setting of massive open spaces and beautiful tree-lined trails, the
